# :white_check_mark: Use **Michael Nygard** ADR template

## Context

There are various ADR templates proposed by different authors; a great list is provided at {{ render("adr-templates-list") }} page by {{ render("joel-parker-henderson") }}. Let's compare a few of them.

{{ render("adr-templates") }}

## Decision

!!! success "Aim for simplicity"
    For now, we will use the original **Michael Nygard** template as it seems to be the simplest one.

## Consequences

{{ render("nygard-pro-et-contra") }}
